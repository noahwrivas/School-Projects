<h3>Smart Home</h3>

<h4>Description:</h4>
<p>The Smart Home was a junior project to replicate the now more common Amazon Alexa. This project took one entire semester (4 months) and cost me and my team less than $60 to create. There was a small amount of saving on smaller components that we had lying around from other projects. The main purpose was to be an all in one security system with smart home capabilities. We were to include the following:
  
  <ul>
    <li>Touch Screen Interface</li>
    <li>Smoke Sensor</li>
    <li>Temperature Sensor</li>
    <li>Weather Api</li>
    <li>Door Sensor</li>
  </ul>
  
Our professor also required that we include various components, these included Digital and Analog Components, an Interface to a Microcontroller or MicroProcessor, and a form of Signal Processing.
