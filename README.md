<h3>Smart Home</h3>
<h4>Description:</h4>
<p>The Smart Home was a junior project to replicate the now more common Amazon Alexa. This project took one entire semester (4 months) and cost me and my team less than $60 to create. There was a large amount of savings on smaller components because we had plenty lying around from other projects. The main purpose was to be an all in one security system with smart home capabilities. We were to include the following:
  
  <ul>
    <li>Touch Screen Interface</li>
    <li>Smoke Sensor</li>
    <li>Temperature Sensor</li>
    <li>Weather API</li>
    <li>Door Sensor</li>
  </ul>
  
Our professor also required that we include various components, these included Digital and Analog Components, an Interface to a Microcontroller or MicroProcessor, and a form of Signal Processing.

There is a lot to say about this project, an entire report has been writen about it which you can read more about <a href="https://github.com/noahwrivas/School-Projects/blob/master/Smart%20Home/Smart-Home-Report.md">here</a>.</p>
